Mission 1:

starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx3.googlemail.com
starwars.com    MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = aspmx.l.google.com
starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt1.aspx.l.google.com
starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = alt2.aspmx.l.google.com
starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx2.googlemail.com 

The Resistance is not receiving any emails because neither "asltx.l.google.com" nor "asltx.2.google.com" are configured
to be part of the DNS records.

A corrected DNS record should be:

starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx3.googlemail.com
starwars.com    MX preference = 1, mail exchanger = asltx.l.google.com 
starwars.com    MX preference = 5, mail exchanger = asltx.2.google.com 
starwars.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx2.googlemail.com 

Mission 2:

v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215

The Force's emails are going to spam because the mail server is only configured to send emails to 104.156.250.80, 45.63.15.159, and 45.63.4.215.
Since theforce.net changed their IP address of their mail server to 45.23.175.21, the SPF record should replace the the previously mentioned IPs with 45.23.176.21.

Corrected DNS record:

v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:45.23.176.21

Mission 3:

CNAME of www.theforce.net is www.theforce.net.Home.

resistance.theforce.net isn't redirecting to theforce.net because  resistance.theforce.net is a non-existent domain.

To correct the DNS record, you would add "resistance.theforce.net. IN CNAME theforce.net." in the DNS zone file.

Mission 4:

Name:    princessleia.site
Addresses: 34.102.136.180
           20.40.202.19 

To fix the DNS record we would add the backup DNS server ns2.galaxybackup.com to "/etc/resolve.conf":

"search princessleia.site
nameserver <main_ip>
nameserver ns2.galaxybackup.com"

This would automatically reroute users to the backup DNS server if the main server goes offline.

Mission 5:

Batuu -> d -> c -> e -> f -> j -> k -> o -> r -> s -> jedha
