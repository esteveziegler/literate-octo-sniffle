Day 2 Questions:
1. Identify the offensive traffic.

Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine:

When did the interaction occur?

The interaction occured within the last day, so we limit our timeline on
Kibana to search the data just within the previous day.

What responses did the victim send back?

The top responses that the victim sent back were: 401, 301, 200, 207, 303

What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective?

There is a connection spike in the "Connections over time [Packetbeat Flows]
ECS" graph. Also at the same time there is a spike in the "Errors vs successful
transactions [Packetbeat] ECS" graph.



2. Find the request for the hidden directory.

In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.

How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)?

The folder was requested 9,521 times

Which files were requested? What information did they contain?

We can see in the same panel that the file connect_to_corp_server was requested two times.

What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future?

We could set an alert that goes off for any machine that attempts to access this directory or file.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

This directory and file should be completely taken off the server.



3. Identify the brute force attack.

After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:

Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra?

Yes, in the Discovery page, if you search for: "url.path: /company_folders/secret_folder/"
you will find a few results involving this folder. In these results the "user_agent.original" field
displayed "Mozilla/4.0(Hydra)".

How many requests were made in the brute-force attack?

In the "Top 10 HTTP requests [Packetbeat] ECS" panel, we can see that the password protected "secret_folder" was
requested 9521 times.

How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one?

Despite the 9521 requests to the directory, the file inside that directory was only requested 2 times. 
So, the attacker made 9519 requests before discovering the correct password.

What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)?

We could set an alert if "401 Unauthorized" responses is returned from any server over a certain threshold
that would weed out forgotten passwords. You could start out with 10 responses in one hour and
determine if you need to change it afterwords.


We could also create an alert if the "user_agent.original" field includes "Hydra" in the name.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

After your preset amount of "401 Unauthorized" codes have been returned from a server, that server can automatically drop
traffic from the offending IP address for a period of 1 hour. We could also display a lockout message and lock the
page from login for atemporary period of time from that user.



4. Find the WebDav connection.

Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:

How many requests were made to this directory?

There were 120 requests made to the "/webdav/" directory.

Which file(s) were requested?

The "shell.php" file was requested 38 times and the "passwd.dav" file was requested 18 times.

What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future?

We can create an alert anytime this directory is accessed by a machine other than the machine that should have access.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

Connections to this shared folder should not be accessible from the web interface.

Connections to this shared folder could be restricted by a machine with a firewall rule.



5. Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.

To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer the following questions:

Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session?

Since port 4444 is the default port used for meterpreter, many attackers forget to change this port before attacking. By searching
for traffic on port 4444 (source.ip: 192.168.1.105 and destination.port: 4444) we can find the traffic.

What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future?

We can set an alert for any traffic moving over port 4444.

We can set an alert for any .php file that is uploaded to a server.

Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.

You could remove the ability to upload files to this directory.
